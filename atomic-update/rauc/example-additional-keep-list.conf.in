## The wildcard '*' will match every character, except forward slashes.
## The wildcard '**' is like '*', but it will include forward slashes.

## Keep changes to systemd config
# /etc/systemd/*.conf

## Keep drop-in changes for mkinitcpio
# /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/*.conf

## Keep all edits to any files.
## DANGEROUS! Any files you (or pacman) touch in /etc will forever shadow all
## upstream changes from future atomic updates, leading to hard to diagnose
## breakage. You get to keep the pieces.
